# ChartCoF
ðŸ“„[Paper](xxx)

This repository contains the code to evaluate models on CharXiv from the paper [Chain of Functions: A Programmatic Pipeline for Fine-Grained Chart
Reasoning Data](xxx).


## Evaluation
Here we present how to evaluate the model on ChartCoF dataset. Since there are different environments for models, you need to set up different environments accoding to the model you want to evaluate. Here we provide the example of evaluation code InternVL-2.5-8B. If you want to evaluate on your own models, you need to write customized output functions on `eval_cof/src/generate_lib`.

## Installation

```
conda create -n cof python=3.9
conda activate cof
cd InternVL/
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install flash-attn==2.3.6 --no-build-isolation
```

Please follow the instructions in the [InternVL documentation](https://internvl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started/installation.html) to install the required dependencies.

## Run
We first generate the answer files. We provide the prompts for directly outputting the answer `input_option=only_answer` and CoT `input_option=cot`. You can also use your custermized output functions by modifying the `eval_cof/src/query_utils.py`.

```
python src/evaluate.py \
    --model_path path-to-internvl25_8b \
    --model_name internvl25 \
    --directory ./ \
    --question_path ./chartcof.json \
    --answers_path ./results/chartcof_internvl25_8b_only_answer.jsonl \
    --temperature 0.0 \
    --top_p 1.0 \
    --num_beams 1 \
    --input_option only_answer \
    --batch_size 1
```

Evaluate the generated answer files.

```
python eval_cof/src/get_score.py \
    --response_path results/chartcof_internvl25_8b_only_answer.jsonl
```

Optional: For those models with weak instruction-following capabilities we provide question extraction using GPT-4o.

```
python eval_cof/src/extract_answer.py \
    --response_path results/chartcof_internvl25_8b_only_answer.jsonl
```

Compute the statistics for the models with respect to the question type, Annotation, and chart type.

```
python eval_cof/src/get_stat_basic.py \
    --score_path results/chartcof_internvl25_8b_only_answer_score.jsonl
```

Compute the adavaned statistics for the models with respect to the Step Number, and Function Chains.

```
python eval_cof/src/get_stat.py \
    --score_path results/chartcof_internvl25_8b_only_answer_score.jsonl
```
